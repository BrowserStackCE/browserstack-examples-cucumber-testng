## Introduction

TestNG is a testing framework designed to simplify a broad range of testing needs, from unit testing (testing a class in isolation of the others) to integration testing (testing entire systems made of several classes, several packages and even several external frameworks, such as application servers). Cucumber is a software tool that supports behavior-driven development (BDD).

This BrowserStack Example repository demonstrates a Selenium test framework written in Cucumber and TestNG  with parallel testing capabilties. The Selenium test scripts are written for the open source [BrowserStack Demo web application](https://bstackdemo.com) ([Github](https://github.com/browserstack/browserstack-demo-app)). This BrowserStack Demo App is an e-commerce web application which showcases multiple real-world user scenarios, written in Next and React. The app is bundled with offers data, orders data and products data that contains everything you need to start using the app and run tests out-of-the-box.

The Selenium tests are run on different platforms like on-prem, docker and BrowserStack using various run configurations and test capabilities.

---

# On Premise / Self Hosted

This infrastructure points to running the Selenium tests on your own machine using a browser (e.g. Chrome) using the browser's driver executables (e.g. ChromeDriver for Chrome). Selenium enables this functionality using WebDriver for many popular browsers.

## Prerequisites

- For this infrastructure configuration (i.e on-premise), ensure that the ChromeDriver executable is placed in the `/src/test/resources/drivers` folder.

Note: The ChromeDriver version must match the Chrome browser version on your machine.

## Running Your Tests

### Run a specific test on your own machine

- How to run the test?

  To run the default test scenario (e.g. End to End Scenario) on your own machine, use the following command:

  Maven:
    ```sh
  mvn install -P on-prem
  ```

  Gradle:
    ```sh 
  <Gradle command>
  ```

  To run a specific test scenario, use the following command with the additional 'test-name' argument:

  Maven:
  ```sh
  mvn install -P -Dcucumber.options="<Feature File Location>"
  ```

  Gradle:
  ```sh
  <Gradle command>
  ```

  where,  the argument 'test-name' can be any Cucumber scenario name configured in this repository.

  E.g. "End to End Scenario", "Login as username", "Login as Locked User", "Offers for mumbai geo-location", "Apply Apple Vendor Filter", "Apply Lowest to Highest Order By", "Login as User with no image loaded", "Login as User with existing Orders"

- Output

  This run profile executes a specific test scenario on a single browser instance on your own machine.


### Run the entire test suite on your own machine

- How to run the test?

  To run the entire test suite on your own machine, use the following command:

  Maven:
  ```sh
  mvn install -P on-prem-suite
  ```

  Gradle:
  ```sh
  <Gradle command>
  ```

- Output

  This run profile executes the entire test suite sequentially on a single browser, on your own machine.

# Docker

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. By taking advantage of Dockerï¿½s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

## Prerequisites

- Install and start [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
- Note: Docker should be running on the test machine. Ensure Docker Compose is installed as well.
- Run `docker-compose pull` from the current directory of the repository.

## Running Your Tests

### Run a specific test on the docker infrastructure

- How to run the test?

  - Start the Selenium Grid hosted within the Docker by running the following command:

  ```sh
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

  - To run the default test scenario (e.g. End to End Scenario) on your own machine, use the following command:

  Maven:
  ```sh
  mvn test -P docker
  ```

  Gradle:
    ```sh
  <Gradle command>
  ```

  To run a specific test scenario, use the following command with the additional 'test-name' argument:

  Maven:
  ```sh
  mvn install -P docker -Dcucumber.options="<Feature File Location>"
  ```

  Gradle:
  ```sh
  <Gradle command>
  ```

  where,  the argument 'test-name' can be any Cucumber scenario name configured in this repository.

  E.g. "End to End Scenario", "Login as username", "Login as Locked User", "Offers for mumbai geo-location", "Apply Apple Vendor Filter", "Apply Lowest to Highest Order By", "Login as User with no image loaded", "Login as User with existing Orders"


- After tests are complete, you can stop the Selenium Grid by running the following command:

  ```sh
  docker-compose down
  ```

- Output

  This run profile executes a specific test scenario on a single browser deployed on a Selenium Grid docker image.


### Run the entire test suite in parallel using Docker

- How to run the test?

  - Start the Selenium Grid docker image first by running the following command:

  ```sh
  docker-compose up -d
  docker-compose scale chromenode=3
  ```

  - To run the entire test suite in parallel on the docker image, use the following command:

  Maven:
  ```sh
  mvn test -P docker-parallel
  ```

  Gradle:
  ```sh
  <Gradle command>
  ```

  - After the tests are complete stop the Selenium grid by running the following command:

  ```sh
  docker-compose down
  ```

- Output

  This run profile executes the entire test suite in parallel on a single browser, deployed on a Selenium Grid docker image

# BrowserStack

BrowserStack Automate provides instant Selenium testing on desktop browsers, real iOS and Android devices.

## Prerequisites

- Create a new [BrowserStack account](https://www.browserstack.com/users/sign_up) or use an existing one.
- Identify your BrowserStack username and access key from the [BrowserStack Automate Dashboard](https://automate.browserstack.com/) and export them as environment variables using the below commands.

  - For \*nix based and Mac machines:

  ```sh
  export BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME=<browserstack-username> &&
